# Overview

Goal: Learn about Data Analysis and how to turn it into digestable information using matplotlib and graphs.

I analyzed a Data set that shows presence of Heart Disease and its relation to multiple other potentially contributing factors.

With the software I wrote, the first chart shows the Relationship between cholesterol levels and heart disease. The second chart 
shows the relationship between the Impact of exercise-induced angina on heart disease.
